api_tester is a simple script for testing APIs built against api_producer.
This script does not do any type of setup. It assumes systems (db, web server,
etc) are already up and running. The main purpose is basically unit tests for
the API as a whole.

See sample_tests.pl for a an incomplete example.

Usage:

$ ./api_tester.pl -c ~/github/kimor79/nodegroups-api/api_tester/v2_w_create_nodegroup.pl
# Unique string is api_tester.pl44911336789725
ok 1 - create_nodegroup.php: requests != responses
ok 2 - create_nodegroup.php: request -> JSON
not ok 3 - create_nodegroup.php: HTTP 2xx
#   Failed test 'create_nodegroup.php: HTTP 2xx'
#   at ./bin/api_tester.pl line 153.
# 500 Internal Server Error
